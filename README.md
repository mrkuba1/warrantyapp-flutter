## **Description:** 
A mobile app storing warranty data for products purchased by the user. Making this project taught me a lot, from better level of Dart and flutter to using GitHub.

## **Installation**

Open terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mrkuba1/warrantyapp-flutter.git

cd warrantyapp-flutter

```
Next you must have installed Flutter on your device. More read [Flutter documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)

After that, open the project and install all dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
flutter packages get
```
